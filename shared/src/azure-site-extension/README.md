# SignalFx .NET Tracing Azure Site Extension

Code in this folder is used to build a [Azure Site Extension](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Azure-Site-Extensions)
that installs the [SignalFx .NET Tracing](../../README.md).

An Azure Site Extension is a specially crafted [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/)

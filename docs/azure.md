# Azure instrumentation guide

## App Service

1. Choose your app in Azure App Service.
2. Go to **Development Tools > Extensions**.
3. Find and install the **SignalFx .NET Tracing** extension.
4. Go to **Settings > Configuration**.
5. Click **New application setting** to add the following settings:

   Access token: See [here](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/admin/authentication-tokens/org-tokens.html) to learn how to obtain one. 

   * Name: `SIGNALFX_ACCESS_TOKEN`
   * Value: `[splunk-observability-cloud-access-token]`

   In the endpoint URL, ``splunk-realm`` is the [O11y realm](https://dev.splunk.com/observability/docs/realms_in_endpoints). For example, ``us0``.

   * Name: `SIGNALFX_ENDPOINT_URL`
   * Value: `https://ingest.[splunk-realm].signalfx.com/v2/trace`
6. Restart the application in App Service.


> **Tip:** To reduce latency and benefit from OTel Collector features, you can set the endpoint URL setting to a Collector instance running in Azure VM over an Azure private network.

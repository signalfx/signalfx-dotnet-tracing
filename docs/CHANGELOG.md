## [Release 0.2.0](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-dotnet-tracing/releases/tag/v0.2.0)

### General

- The release contains significant changes as it is based on the latest
  [.NET Tracer for Datadog APM](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-dotnet)
  with modifications to make it work with the
  [Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector)
  and directly with [Splunk Observability Cloud](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/observability.html).
  Some of the changes are breaking. Please contact us if you miss any feature
  from the previous release.

### Breaking changes

- There is no support for .NET Framework older than .NET Framework 4.6.1.
- There is no support for Alpine Linux.
- There are no new releases for [`SignalFx.Tracing`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SignalFx.Tracing.OpenTracing/)
nor [`SignalFx.Tracing.OpenTracing`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SignalFx.Tracing.OpenTracing/)
NuGet packages. For manual instrumentation use [`OpenTracing`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenTracing/)
instead. You can find more information in the documentation.
- Rename `SIGNALFX_DOTNET_TRACER_CONFIG_FILE` configuration to `SIGNALFX_TRACE_CONFIG_FILE`.
- Rename `SIGNALFX_PROPAGATOR` configuration to `SIGNALFX_PROPAGATORS`.
- Rename `SIGNALFX_TRACING_ENABLED` configuration to `SIGNALFX_TRACE_ENABLED`
- Rename `SIGNALFX_ASPNET_TEMPLATE_NAMES_ENABLED` configuration to `SIGNALFX_TRACE_ROUTE_TEMPLATE_RESOURCE_NAMES_ENABLED`.
- Remove `SIGNALFX_ADD_CLIENT_IP_TO_SERVER_SPANS` configuration.
  New, fixed behavior is equivalent to flag enabled.
- Remove `SIGNALFX_SYNC_SEND` configuration.
- Remove `SIGNALFX_TRACE_DOMAIN_NEUTRAL_INSTRUMENTATION` configuration.
- Remove `SIGNALFX_APPEND_URL_PATH_TO_NAME` configuration as it was against the
  [OpenTelemetry Semantic conventions for HTTP spans](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/http.md#name).
  Take notice that the URL is available via `http.url` tag.
- Remove `SIGNALFX_USE_WEBSERVER_RESOURCE_AS_OPERATION_NAME` configuration.
  New, fixed behavior is equivalent to flag enabled,
  in order to better align with  [OpenTelemetry Semantic conventions for HTTP spans](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/http.md#name).
- Remove `SIGNALFX_SANITIZE_SQL_STATEMENTS` configuration as all field
  sanitizations are moving to the [Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/gdi/opentelemetry/opentelemetry.html).
- Remove `SIGNALFX_OUTBOUND_HTTP_EXCLUDED_HOSTS` configuration as
  [Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/gdi/opentelemetry/opentelemetry.html)
  is the recommended place for spans filtering.
  If you need span exclusion for specific URL substrings, it can be configured
  using `SIGNALFX_TRACE_HTTP_CLIENT_EXCLUDED_URL_SUBSTRINGS` environment variable.
- Remove `SIGNALFX_INSTRUMENTATION_ASPNETCORE_DIAGNOSTIC_LISTENERS` configuration
  which is no longer needed. It provided a workaround for an issue in a specific
  version of a library, which broke default instrumentation, and was already fixed.
- Remove `SIGNALFX_SERVICE_NAME_PER_SPAN_ENABLED` configuration as
  [the OpenTelemetry specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/resource/sdk.md)
  requires that the resources (such us as [service](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/main/specification/resource/semantic_conventions#service))
  have to be immutable.
- Remove `SIGNALFX_INTEGRATIONS`. This configuration is not needed.
  The instrumentation called `CallSite` was removed.
- Deprecate `SIGNALFX_TRACE_LOG_PATH`. Please use `SIGNALFX_TRACE_LOG_DIRECTORY`.

### Enhancements

- Add [Aerospike.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aerospike.Client/)
  library instrumentation.
- Add [Microsoft.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Data.SqlClient/)
  and [`System.Data.SqlClient`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.sqlclient)
  library instrumentation.
- Adopt [OpenTelemetry Trace Semantic Conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/main/specification/trace/semantic_conventions)
  in most of the instrumentations.
- Add `SIGNALFX_HTTP_SERVER_ERROR_STATUSES` configuration that controls server
  HTTP statuses to set spans as errors.
- Add `SIGNALFX_HTTP_CLIENT_ERROR_STATUSES` configuration that controls client
  HTTP statuses to set spans as errors.
- Add `SIGNALFX_STDOUT_LOG_TEMPLATE` configuration that configures `stdout` template.
- Add `SIGNALFX_TRACE_DELAY_WCF_INSTRUMENTATION_ENABLED` configuration that
  enables the updated WCF instrumentation that delays execution until later in
  the WCF pipeline when the WCF server exception handling is established.
- Add `SIGNALFX_TRACE_HEADER_TAGS` configuration that sets a map of header keys
  to tag names.
- Add `SIGNALFX_TRACE_KAFKA_CREATE_CONSUMER_SCOPE_ENABLED` configuration that
  closes consumer scope on method enter, and starts a new one on method exit.
- Add `SIGNALFX_TRACE_LOG_DIRECTORY` configuration that sets directory for logs
  and overrides the value in `SIGNALFX_TRACE_LOG_PATH` if present.
- Add `SIGNALFX_TRACE_LOGGING_RATE` configuration that sets the number of seconds
  between identical log messages for tracer log files.
- Add `SIGNALFX_TRACE_PARTIAL_FLUSH_ENABLED` configuration that enables partial
  flush of traces.
- Add `SIGNALFX_TRACE_PARTIAL_FLUSH_MIN_SPANS` configuration that sets the minimum
  number of closed spans in a trace before it's partially flushed.
- Add `SIGNALFX_VERSION` configuration that sets the application's version that
  will populate the `version` tag on spans.
- Add `SIGNALFX_TRACE_STARTUP_LOGS` configuration that enables diagnostic log
  at startup.
- Add `SIGNALFX_TRACE_{0}_ENABLED` configuration pattern that enables/disables
  specific integration.
- Add `SIGNALFX_TRACE_HTTP_CLIENT_EXCLUDED_URL_SUBSTRINGS` configuration that
  sets URLs skipped by the tracer.
- Add `SIGNALFX_AZURE_APP_SERVICES` configuration that indicates the profiler
  is running in the context of Azure App Services.
- `SIGNALFX_ENDPOINT_URL` now defaults to `http://localhost:9411/api/v2/spans`.

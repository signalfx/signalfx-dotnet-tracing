# Changelog

All notable changes to this repository are documented in this file.

The format is based on the [Splunk GDI specification](https://github.com/signalfx/gdi-specification/blob/v1.0.0/specification/repository.md),
and this repository adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### General

- The release contains significant changes as it is based on the latest
  [.NET Tracer for Datadog APM](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-dotnet)
  with modifications to make it working with the
  [Splunk OpenTelemetry Connector](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector)
  and directly with [Splunk Observabilty Cloud](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/observability.html).
  Some of the changes are breaking. Please contact us if you miss any feature
  from the previous release.

### Breaking changes

- Remove `SIGNALFX_APPEND_URL_PATH_TO_NAME` configuration as it was against the
  [OpenTelemetry Semantic conventions for HTTP spans](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/http.md#name).
  Take notice that the URL is available via `http.url` tag.
- Remove `SIGNALFX_USE_WEBSERVER_RESOURCE_AS_OPERATION_NAME` configuration. New, fixed behavior is equivalent to flag enabled,
  in order to better align with  [OpenTelemetry Semantic conventions for HTTP spans](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/http.md#name).
- Remove `SIGNALFX_SANITIZE_SQL_STATEMENTS` configuration as all field sanitizations are moving to the [Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/gdi/opentelemetry/opentelemetry.html).
- Remove `SIGNALFX_OUTBOUND_HTTP_EXCLUDED_HOSTS` configuration as [Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/gdi/opentelemetry/opentelemetry.html) is the recommended place for spans filtering.
  If you need span exclusion for specific url substrings, it can be configured using `SIGNALFX_TRACE_HTTP_CLIENT_EXCLUDED_URL_SUBSTRINGS` environment variable.
- Remove `SIGNALFX_INSTRUMENTATION_ASPNETCORE_DIAGNOSTIC_LISTENERS` configuration which is no longer needed. It provided a workaround for an issue in a specific version of a library, which broke default instrumentation, and was already fixed.  

### Enhancements

- Adopt [OpenTelemetry Trace Semantic Conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/main/specification/trace/semantic_conventions)
  in most of the instrumentations.

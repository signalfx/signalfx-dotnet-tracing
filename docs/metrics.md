# Metrics

> :construction: &nbsp;Status: Experimental - exported telemetry and
> configuration settings may change.

The SignalFx Instrumentation for .NET includes automatic runtime metrics collection.
When enabled, metrics are periodically captured and sent
to Splunk Observability Cloud.

To enable runtime metrics, set the `SIGNALFX_RUNTIME_METRICS_ENABLED` environment
variable to `true` for your .NET process.

> Runtime metrics are automatically enabled when [AlwaysOn memory profiling](internal/memory-profiling.md) is enabled. Memory profiling setting overrides metrics setting (runtime metrics will always be enabled if memory profiling is enabled, even if `SIGNALFX_RUNTIME_METRICS_ENABLED` is set to `false`). 

The following metrics are collected by default after enabling .NET metrics.
To learn about differences between SignalFx metric types, visit [documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/metrics-and-metadata/metric-types.html#metric-types).

## .NET runtime metrics

## Additional permissions for IIS

The .NET Framework collects gc heap size metrics using performance counters.
To let service accounts and IIS application pool accounts access counter data,
add them to the `Performance Monitoring Users` group.

IIS application pools use special accounts that do not appear in the list
of users. To add IIS application pool accounts to the `Performance Monitoring Users`
group, search for `IIS APPPOOL\<name-of-the-pool>`. For example, the user for
the `DefaultAppPool` pool is `IIS APPPOOL\DefaultAppPool`.

The following example shows how to add an IIS application pool account to
the `Performance Monitoring Users` group from a command prompt with
Administrator permissions:

```batch
net localgroup "Performance Monitor Users" "IIS APPPOOL\DefaultAppPool" /add
```

## Trace metrics

The SignalFx Instrumentation for .NET supports trace metrics collection.

To enable additional metrics related to traces, set the `SIGNALFX_TRACE_METRICS_ENABLED`
environment variable to `true` for your .NET process.

| `signalfx.tracer.queue.enqueued_spans`   | The total number of spans pushed into the queue.          | Counter  |
| `signalfx.tracer.queue.dequeued_spans`   | The number of spans pulled from the queue for flushing.   | Counter  |
| `signalfx.tracer.queue.dropped_traces`   | The total number of traces dropped due to a full queue.   | Counter  |
| `signalfx.tracer.queue.dropped_spans`    | The total number of spans dropped due to a full queue.    | Counter  |
| `signalfx.tracer.heartbeat`              | The total number of tracers.                              | Gauge    |
